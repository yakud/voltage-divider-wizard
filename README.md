## Features

- 🧮 Calculate optimal resistor combinations for voltage dividers
- 📊 Visual representation of the circuit using Mermaid diagrams
- 🛠 Customizable list of available resistors
- 💾 Automatic saving of inputs and resistor list in local storage

## How to Use

1. Visit the [Voltage Divider Wizard](https://yakud.github.io/voltage-divider-wizard/)
2. Enter your desired input voltage and output voltage
3. Specify the maximum number of resistors to use in the circuit
4. Click "Calculate" to see the optimal resistor combination
5. View the results, including the actual output voltage and circuit diagram

You can also customize the list of available resistors:
- Add new resistors using the form at the bottom of the page
- Remove existing resistors by clicking the "Remove" button next to each resistor

Your inputs and customized resistor list will be automatically saved for your next visit.
